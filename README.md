# Frippertronics in Pd

**Frippertronics in Pd is based on bapch's RE-150 Space Echo simulation.**
* Link to repo: https://github.com/bapch/RE-Tape-Echo
* This is meant as a lightweight replacement of the AKAI GX-210D's I normally used to play with.

* Uses the controls from the NanoKontrol scheme here: https://github.com/markijzerman/mijlooper/blob/master/nanokontrol2_scheme.nktrl2_data


### TODO
* Probably also for Organelle
