# Frippertronics in Pd

**Frippertronics in Pd is based on bapch's RE-150 Space Echo simulation.**

* This is meant as a lightweight replacement of the AKAI GX-210D's I normally used to play with.

### TODO
* set startup/most used init controls
* Make proper controls for use on Blokas Pisound with a NanoKontrol MK2
* Probably also for Organelle
